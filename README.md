Random Forest and SVM Radial is used R
* General preparation of the dataset for machine learning
* Visualization of feature distribution by class
* Pre-processing: imputation of missing data, one-hot encoding, and normalization
* Removing low information features
* Visualization of feature importance
* Definitions of metrics of performance for classification problems: Sensitivity, Specificity, etc.
* Hyperparameter tuning, using either a preset tuning length or a specified tuning grid
* Using non-standard sampling methods to correct for class imbalance
* Altering boundaries for classifier thresholds
* Training and resampling multiple models
